# RISC-V RV32I Pipelined Processor (Verilog Implementation)

## Description

This project presents a Verilog-based implementation of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor adhering to the RV32I instruction set architecture. The processor is constructed using modular design principles with components including:

- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- CU (Control Unit)
- IFU (Instruction Fetch Unit)
- IMU (Instruction Memory Unit)
- RFU (Register File Unit)

These modules are connected through pipeline registers, forming a classic IF-ID-EX-MEM-WB pipeline structure.

To facilitate execution, a custom Python-based assembler has also been developed. It takes RISC-V assembly instructions from a `.txt` file and translates them into binary machine code, outputting to another file that serves as input for the processor.

## Features

- Full support for the RV32I instruction set
- Modular Verilog design for each pipeline stage
- 5-stage pipelined architecture
- Custom Python-based assembler
- Instruction decoding reference sheet in Excel
- Ready for simulation and future synthesis

## Architecture Overview

This processor uses a 5-stage pipeline to improve instruction throughput by overlapping instruction execution:

## Module Overview

| Module | Description |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IFU` | Instruction Fetch Unit – retrieves instructions from memory |
| `RFU` | Register File Unit – handles register read and write |
| `ALU` | Executes arithmetic and logic operations |
| `IMU` | Instruction Memory Unit – stores program instructions |
| `CU` | Control Unit – decodes instructions and generates control signals |
| `TOP` | Top-level module – connects and synchronizes all pipeline stages |

## Python Assembler

A Python script is included that functions as an assembler for the RV32I instruction set. It performs the following:

- Reads assembly instructions from an input `.txt` file
- Parses and converts each instruction into 32-bit binary format
- Writes the binary output to another `.txt` file, which can be used as input for the processor's instruction memory

---

## Instruction Reference Sheet

An Excel-based instruction reference sheet is included in the repository. It contains:

- Instruction formats (R, I, S, B, U, J)
- Opcode, funct3, and funct7 fields
- Binary representations and decoding logic

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/JaYs30405/RISC-V-RV32I-Pipelined-Processor-Verilog-Implementation-.git
3. Open the Verilog files in your preferred simulator (ModelSim, Vivado, Icarus Verilog, etc.)
4. Assemble a program using the provided Python script
5. Load the output into the instruction memory and run simulations.

## Future Work

- Add support for the RV32M extension (multiply/divide)
- Implement branch prediction algorithms
- Add instruction and data caches
- to debug the code and inspect every variables by writing a code for debugger making it easier for any user to understand instead of viewing all the variables in modelsim
